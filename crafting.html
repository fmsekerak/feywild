      <h2>Crafting</h2>
      <p>Al items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is completed in 2 hour chunks.
Some branches of crafting must make al their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some
do not. A crafting rol is made every 2 hours of work on an item. On success, you mark 2
hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is
complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2
hours. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and al materials are lost.

During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a crafting project if you
do nothing else during the long rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have
disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a −5 to al Passive Perception checks
as you are focused on your craft. For some types of crafting, like alchemy, you can’t make
incremental progress, but you can continue for 2 additional hours of crafting before or
after a long rest.</p>
